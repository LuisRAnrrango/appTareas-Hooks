This project was created with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In this repository you can find the code of a web application which was developed with react + bootstrap, in the application you can create, edit and delete tasks, this is done as a complement for Kruger Star training.

## Getting Started

**In this repository I am going to create a page containing the development of a page that works as a To Do list for Kuger Star.**

## Run it üî®

Use the following steps to run this Portfolio locally:

- install nodeJs

- open the terminal

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- get in the directory you want this folder to appear

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

- put: git clone `https://github.com/LuisRAnrrango/appTareas-Hooks.git`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- open the folder with a new terminal (This can be done with a code editor or directly in the terminal.)
- put "npm start"

### `npm run eject`

### Deployment

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
For a live demo please click on the following link:

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
